* Introduction

A collaborative music endeavor, mostly inspired ancient Ionian
ideas of numerical harmony in the universe. Done as a part of
PSU CS 410 with Professor Barton Massey.

Right now, there is nothing here, other than a few zeromq
examples. Please come back when the principle authors have
succeeded in some small measure. There will be cake served.

** TODO
+ Create build system. (Autotools)

+ Flesh out a rough-ish design.

+ Shake hands, satisfied with a project well executed.
